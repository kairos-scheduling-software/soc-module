# Kairos SOC Module

This module was built for the University of Utah School of Computing.  It is intended to be used to assist in the process of creating class schedules.  To that end, it leverages the Kairos constraint based schedule solver API and also provides a suite of data tools for analyzing historical scheduling data.
